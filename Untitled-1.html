    <h1> INCREASING AWARENESS REGARDING CLEANLINESS </h1>
    <p> Cleanliness is next to Godliness. We have heard this phrase many times. But do we follow this? A lot of people don’t, even though we should. However, some of us don’t even respect the people who clean the trash. There are a lot of cons for not maintaining cleanliness. Cleanliness should be followed by everyone. Let’s find out more about it.</p><img src="webpage%201.jpg" alt="cleanliness image" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;">
    <p>Cleanliness, as much good as this word sounds also the same is the meaning of that. It is first step to a nation to improvise. Its is the duty of each and every citizen to keep his/her country neat and clean. Also, many people don't follow the guidelines relased by government and litter garbage here and there and not disposing waste properly. Moreover people find them selves to be more cool when they do this, ignoring the fact what society thinks of them! And also in many people living in slum areas, swachhta is a dream due to regular living habits developed among the people. </p>
    <p> So, Our mission is to arouse fact of cleanliness among such people and teaching them how to perform this duty efficiently and correctly and not only ours it should be the mission of each and every citizen as it will effect the  whole country.</p>

    <h2> WHY WE NEED CLEANLINESS?</h2>
    <br />
    <p><img src="h2photo.jpg" alt="cleanliness image" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;">With the help of cleanliness, we can keep our physical and mental health clean, which will make us feel good. Cleanliness gives rise to a good character by keeping body, mind, and soul clean and peaceful. Maintaining cleanliness is the essential part of healthy living because it is the cleanliness only which helps to improve our personality by keeping clean externally and internally.</p>
    <p>Sanitation and neatness play an important role in our day to day routine. It is important as it prevents dangerous diseases like Dengue, typhoid, hepatitis, and other diseases caused by mosquito bite, etc.<br /><br />Diseases like Jaundice, Cholera, Ascariasis, Leptospirosis, Ringworm, Scabies, Schistosomiasis, Trachoma, etc can be spread due to eating contaminated food, drinking contaminated water or living in an unhygienic condition. Trash also spread bad odour which is difficult to tolerate. There will also be an accumulation of trash and dirt if clean measures aren’t taken.</p>

    <h2> STEPS TAKEN BY GOVERNMENT FOR SANITATION</h2>
    <P><img src="goernmentphoto.jpg" alt="cleanliness image" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;">Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM), Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, or Clean India Mission is a country-wide campaign initiated by the Government of India in 2014 to eliminate open defecation and improve solid waste management. <BR />Initiated by the Government of India, the mission aimed to achieve an "open-defecation free" (ODF) India by 2 October 2019, the 150th anniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi. The objectives of the first phase of the mission also included eradication of manual scavenging, generating awareness and bringing about a behavior change regarding sanitation practices, and augmentation of capacity at the local level. The second phase of the mission aims to sustain the open defecation free status and improve the management of solid and liquid waste. </P>

    <h2> DISPOSAL OF WASTE</h2>
    <p>Waste management (or waste disposal) includes the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological and household. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health.</p>
    
    <p>1.Landfill<br />In this process, the waste that cannot be reused or recycled are separated out and spread as a thin layer in low-lying areas across a city. A layer of soil is added after each layer of garbage. However, once this process is complete, the area is declared unfit for construction of buildings for the next 20 years. Instead, it can only be used as a playground or a park.<br /><br />2. Waste Compaction<br />The waste materials such as cans and plastic bottles are compacted into blocks and sent for recycling. This process prevents the oxidation of metals and reduces airspace need, thus making transportation and positioning easy.<br /><br />3.Composting<br />All organic materials decompose with time. Food scraps, yard waste, etc., make up for one of the major organic wastes we throw every day. The process of composting starts with these organic wastes being buried under layers of soil and then, are left to decay under the action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi.This results in the formation of nutrient-rich manure. Also, this process ensures that the nutrients are replenished in the soil. Besides enriching the soil, composting also increases the water retention capacity. In agriculture, it is the best alternative to chemical fertilizers.<br /><br />4. Vermicomposting<br />Vermicomposting is the process of using worms for the degradation of organic matter into nutrient-rich manure. Worms consume and digest the organic matter. The by-products of digestion which are excreted out by the worms make the soil nutrient-rich, thus enhancing the growth of bacteria and fungi. It is also far more effective than traditional composting.</p>
